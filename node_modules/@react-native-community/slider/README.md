**Migrating from the core `react-native` module**

This module was created when the Slider was split out from the core of React Native.
<br/>To migrate to this module you need to follow the installation instructions above and then change you imports from:

```javascript
import { Slider } from 'react-native';
```

to:

```javascript
import Slider from '@react-native-community/slider';
```
